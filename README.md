## Simulation of a Thermal Energy Storage using Computational Fluid Dynamics methods

The availability of energy has always represented a fundamental need for the
human life, and it will continue to be like this in the future as well. In the past energy
was mainly provided by fossil fuels, but because of their shortage and the interest in
cleaner and more efficient energy sources, engineers started to look for new ways of
producing energy. The energy coming from the sun is the most plentiful source human
being can exploit on the Earth, with 885 milion of Terawatt hours (TWh) reaching the
terrestrial surface. The two technologies which are mainly used take advantage of solar
energy are the Photovoltaic System and the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), which is
briefly analysed in this paragraph.
A CSP system uses the solar radiation as energy source at high temperature. In
order to reach temperatures which are competitive with those reached through fossil
fuels, the radiation is concentrated on a solar receptacle, where it is then transferred to
the heat transfer fluid as thermal energy. The fluid flows along the receptacles and
transfers the heat, which, in case of production of electric energy, it is converted into
superheated steam that activates the turbine through a thermodynamic cycle.

As shown in Fig. 1.1, CSPs cannot perform their activity when solar radiation does not
hit the Earth surface. Anyway, these systems present the intrinsic characteristic of
storing energy, thanks to their thermal inertia, and this is what makes this technology
really interesting. In the CSP technology, the word “thermal storage” indicates the
accumulation of the exceeding thermal energy during the daily hours, so that it can be
available after the sunset or in other moments of the daytime so as to supply all the
needs required by the electric network.
The exceeding energy is stored in the so called Thermal Energy Storage (TES). This
system is active if the storage medium can move, while it is referred to as passive if the
storage medium is stationary. The developed code simulates a passive TES. In such a
system, hot and cold temperatures coexist, yielding to a vertical temperature gradient.
The heat transfer fluid transports energy to the medium during the charging phase, and
receives it from the same medium during the discharging phase, taking it to the turbine
in those moments of the day when the solar radiation is missing.
